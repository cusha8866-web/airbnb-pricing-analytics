# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     ✔ Price Distribution Analysis: Examined skewness and pricing spread. Identified high-value clusters and anomalies
     ✔ Location-Based Pricing Trends: Compared average prices across neighborhoods. Identified premium and budget zones
     ✔ Room Type Impact: Analyzed pricing variation between: Entire home/apartment, Private room, Shared room
     ✔ Review & Demand Patterns: Studied correlation between reviews and pricing. Evaluated availability trends and demand behavior
# Key Insights & Trends
Analysis of 100,000+ Airbnb listings revealed clear pricing and demand patterns. Prices are right-skewed, with most properties in the low-to-mid range and a small segment of luxury listings driving the upper extremes. Pricing is strongly influenced by neighbourhood and room type.
    1. Entire home/apartment listings dominate the market and command the highest average prices, indicating strong demand 
       for privacy and convenience. 
    2. Private rooms serve as budget-friendly alternatives, while shared rooms have minimal representation.
    3. High-listing neighbourhoods correspond to prime tourist and commercial zones, showing concentrated demand and competitive 
       activity.
    4. Review trends indicate growing platform usage over time, with seasonal fluctuations reflecting travel cycle.
    5. Overall, location and room type are the primary drivers of pricing and booking activity, with limited long-term
       impact from extreme price outliers after data cleaning.
# Recommendations
  1. Adopt location-based pricing, as neighbourhood significantly influences demand and average listing prices.
  2. Focus on entire home offerings for higher revenue potential while positioning private rooms as budget-friendly options.
  3. Strengthen review management, since higher review engagement improves booking performance and trust.
  4. Apply dynamic pricing strategies during seasonal demand spikes to maximize occupancy and revenue.
  5. Benchmark prices against market averages to control outliers and remain competitive.
